Model -- Vader Model 
VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media, and works well on texts from other domains
The sum of pos, neg, neu intensities give 1. Compound ranges from -1 to 1 and is the metric used to draw the overall sentiment.
positive if compound >= 0.5
neutral if -0.5 < compound < 0.5
negative if -0.5 >= compound

I have deployed the model on streamlit platform
